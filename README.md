# Tufty-2040 Badge files
- This is where all files used on my device will be found.
- I built upon the provided template files as I have much to learn.
- The device can be found here [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tufty-2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tufty-2040?variant=40036912595027)


# Accessories
- Most the time, the badge is attached to my bag or belt using a carabiner that loops through the top hole of the badge. However,
this is seamlessly swapped out for my LGBT University Of Lincoln lanyard.
- As the badge has an LCD display, I have a 1200mah LiPo battery ready to give it portable power. This will be stored in the case I get printed for the badge
eventually. [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-battery-pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/lipo-battery-pack?variant=20429082183)
- I also aqquired a Adafruit micro lipo charger [https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-micro-lipo-w-microusb-jack-usb-liion-lipoly-charger](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-micro-lipo-w-microusb-jack-usb-liion-lipoly-charger?variant=804956441)
for charging the LiPo after use. For testing, I keep the badge connected to a powered Usb-c cable.


# Functions
- As it currently stands, I use it as a personal badge that only has decorative content so far. There is also a store of
images that can be cycled through no matter what current state the badge is set to. As this badge thrives on constant power delivery, I have made use of 
multithreading of the RPM2040s' cpu to allow button input while allowing images to slideshow dynamically.
